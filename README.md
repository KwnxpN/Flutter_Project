# Resonance

Resonance is a music streaming and social matching application designed to improve music
discovery and community interaction among music listeners.

## Problem Overview

Many music listeners lack a dedicated platform to discuss, exchange opinions, and share
experiences related to music. Additionally, existing music streaming and radio applications
often provide recommendations that do not accurately reflect users’ true musical
preferences, making it difficult for users to discover music that matches their interests.

## Project Objective

Resonance aims to solve these problems by enabling users to clearly express their music
preferences and connect with others who share similar musical tastes.

## Project Description

Resonance combines features from music streaming platforms and swipe-based matching systems.
Users can swipe to like or dislike music genres or tracks, allowing the system to understand
their preferences. Based on this data, the application matches users with similar music
tastes and allows them to communicate through an in-app chat system.

## Key Features

- Swipe-based music preference selection
- Matching users with similar music tastes
- In-app chat for music discussion and recommendation
- Enhanced music discovery through user-driven interaction
